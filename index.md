# What threat does AI pose to humanity?



## What is an existential risk?
Exisential risks are potential events that would pose irreversible threat the the existence of humanity. These potential dangers can create harmful effects on how we as a socity progress and can severly disrupt the continuation of human life. Existential risks can come from various sources such as natural disasters, human acitivities or technological developments such as AI, which ill be discussing further in my work.

## What is a digital identity and how can it cause existential risk?
Its important we have understanding of what a digital identity is so that we can acknowledge our own. A digital identity is a representation of an individuals identity on the internet or through digtital systems, these identities contain personal and sensitive information such as a persons date of birth, contact information or bank details. 

## What is AI and how is it being used?
Kaplan and Haenlein define AI as “a system’s ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation” (Kaplan and Haenlein 2019). Artificiall intellegence is helping society with things such as healthcare, education, assistive technologies and autonomous vehichles. It allows for a higher efficiency rate while conducting tasks, therefore helping humans complete tasks earlier or replacing the risky jobs.


## AI:How is AI an existential risk?
While AI presents numerous opportunities for positive impact, it's important to consider and address ethical concerns, biases, and potential risks to ensure responsible and beneficial deployment in society.I believe that deepfake videos being created by AI are huge existential risks.Deepfakes are media such as photos and images that have been digitally manipulated with AI . They reconstruct a person's facial appearance and body language to create realistic and lifelike photos and videos. This means when people see videos and photos online it may be hard for them to tell what is real and what's been constructed. Although some people would argue it will still take many years for AI to create real threat, there have already been numerous occasions where AI has been used to spread fake information. For example, a deepfake video was released of Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelenskyy telling all ukrainains to "lay down their arms "and that he was returning Ukranian land back to Russia. This video was published online globally, luckily the president was quick to falsify these videos, it could have caused thousands of peoples lives to be taken. Soldiers could have potentially backed down and as a result been overtaken by Russian forces due to them having let their guard down due to misinformation. This is just one example of a time AI has been used negatively and had an impact on society, unfortunalty AI will only get more advanced meaning it will be harder for us to spot when videos are fake, creating real threats and allowing governments to use it as a weapon of mass destruction. Therefore fake news spreading creates a sense of epistemic distrust especailly when it comes to politics.

## How fake news can lead to wars and the spread of propoganda? 
Similar to how it was used in the Russia and  Ukraine war, AI is currently being used to spread propaganda during a genocide.
Ai is a technology that has access to a large range of our personal data, it then uses this data to gather knowledge and develop solutions in a human like way. Army's such as the Israeli army are using AI to create fake videos and spread propaganda during wars, therefore posing an existential risk. The videos look real and therefore people can't comprehend what to believe.

## How can we link Digital identity, AI and existential risk?
 We have created AI through our own digital identiies, as it was designed to act and think like people. AI may end with unintended consequences, for example, AI is quickly becoming more sophisticated and that means it may soon surpass human intellegence. Soon AI may act however it pleases and dismiss human values.Although AI has many benefits, It can cause catastrophic existential threat to our digital identites. This is because AI systems have access to our personal data through our digital identity, this means that AI can replecate our identities making it harder for people to spot false identities when it comes to things like deepfakes and fraud. This means that our digital identities are being used by AI in improper ways and as a result can lead to missinformation spreading which could result in wars.


 Below is a poem i've created linking AI and existential risk:

 AI a marvel, a force untamed, 
 
 Yet in it's shadows, existential flames.

 Machines that learn and replicate,
 
 A future shaped, a twist of fate.


 
 Existential whispers in the code,
 
 Warnings that in the circuits bode.

 What if AI, in its ascent, 
 
 Forgets the lessons we invent?
 
 A risk profound, a dire cost,
 
 As humaity's essence may be lost.

 

In the digital echos of the abyss,

Existential risk, we cant dimiss.

## conclusion
In conclusion, although there are many benefits to AI, I believe that it can create huge risks to society such as existential risks that would lead to humanity ending. AI is already advancing at a quick rate, and it will only continue to develop and progress as we feed it more of our personal data through our digital identities. As a result of this it will be hard to contain and will be able to be used as a weapon of masss desturction by world leaders.
