# What threat does AI pose to humanity?

Key words: Artificial intelligence, existential risk, digital identity, catastrophy & weapon of mass destruction

## What is an existential risk?
Exisential risks are potential events that would pose irreversible threat the the existence of humanity. These potential dangers can create harmful effects on how we as a socity progress and can severly disrupt the continuation of human life. Existential risks can come from various sources such as natural disasters, human acitivities or technological developments such as AI, which ill be discussing further in my work.

## What is a digital identity and how can it be linked to existential risk?
Its important we have understanding of what a digital identity is so that we can acknowledge our own. A digital identity is a representation of an individuals identity on the internet or through digtital systems, these identities contain personal and sensitive information such as a persons date of birth, contact information or bank details. 

## What is AI and how is it being used?
Kaplan and Haenlein define AI as “a system’s ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation” (Kaplan and Haenlein 2019). Artificiall intellegence is helping society with things such as healthcare, education, assistive technologies and autonomous vehichles. It allows for a higher efficiency rate while conducting tasks, therefore helping humans complete tasks earlier or replacing the risky jobs.


## AI:How is AI an existential risk?
While AI presents numerous opportunities for positive impact, it's important to consider and address ethical concerns, biases, and potential risks to ensure responsible and beneficial deployment in society.I believe that deepfake videos being created by AI are huge existential risks.Deepfakes are media such as photos and images that have been digitally manipulated with AI . They reconstruct a person's facial appearance and body language to create realistic and lifelike photos and videos. This means when people see videos and photos online it may be hard for them to tell what is real and what's been constructed. Although some people would argue it will still take many years for AI to create real threat, there have already been numerous occasions where AI has been used to spread fake information. For example, a deepfake video was released of Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelenskyy telling all ukrainains to "lay down their arms "and that he was returning Ukranian land back to Russia. This video was published online globally, luckily the president was quick to falsify these videos, it could have caused thousands of peoples lives to be taken. Soldiers could have potentially backed down and as a result been overtaken by Russian forces due to them having let their guard down due to misinformation. This is just one example of a time AI has been used negatively and had an impact on society, unfortunalty AI will only get more advanced meaning it will be harder for us to spot when videos are fake, creating real threats and allowing governments to use it as a weapon of mass destruction. Therefore fake news spreading creates a sense of epistemic distrust especailly when it comes to politics.


The following video shows a modern day example of how AI has been used within society in a negative way:

Similar to how it was used in the Russia and  Ukraine war, AI is currently being used to spread propaganda during a genocide in Gaza.AI is a technology that has access to a large range of our personal data, it then uses this data to gather knowledge and develop solutions in a human like way. Army's such as the Israeli army are using AI to create fake videos and spread propaganda during wars, therefore posing an existential risk. The videos look real and therefore people can't comprehend what to believe. In addition to this the IDF are also using AI to target there missile attacks.
 
'AI is having an impact at all levels of war, from “intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance” support, like the IDF’s Habsora system, through to “lethal autonomous weapons systems” that can choose and attack targets without human intervention.These systems have the potential to reshape the character of war, making it easier to enter into a conflict. As complex and distributed systems, they may also make it more difficult to signal one’s intentions – or interpret those of an adversary – in the context of an escalating conflict' Baggiarini, B. (2023). Israel’s AI can produce 100 bombing targets a day in Gaza.
 This passage shows just how dangerous the use of AI during a warefare is, stating that it can choose to attack targets without human interventions, therefore AI is making catastrophic decisions for us, resulting in thousands of palestinians being murdered everyday due to missile attacks that are calculated by AI. These calculations may also be innacurate and are based of things like cellphone usage in certain areas, they are trying to target the hamas militaray group, however it is predominantly civilians who are being murdered in these attacks. This is just the beginning of AI's use during wars, in the future when AI is more advanced we may heavily rely on it during war, leading to poor deciisons being made and the world possibly ending.



 
## How can we link Digital identity, AI and existential risk?
 We have created AI through our own digital identiies, as it was designed to act and think like people. AI may end with unintended consequences, for example, AI is quickly becoming more sophisticated and that means it may soon surpass human intellegence. Soon AI may act however it pleases and dismiss human values.Although AI has many benefits, It can cause catastrophic existential threat to our digital identites. This is because AI systems have access to our personal data through our digital identity, this means that AI can replecate our identities making it harder for people to spot false identities when it comes to things like deepfakes and fraud. This means that our digital identities are being used by AI in improper ways and as a result can lead to missinformation spreading which could result in wars.


 Below is a poem i've created discussing how AI may become more advanced to a point were we cannot control it and therefore it becomes an existential risk:

 AI a marvel, a force untamed, 
 
 Yet in it's shadows, existential flames.

 Machines that learn and replicate,
 
 A future shaped, a twist of fate.


 
 Existential whispers in the code,
 
 Warnings that in the circuits bode.

 What if AI, in its ascent, 
 
 Forgets the lessons we invent?
 
 A risk profound, a dire cost,
 
 As humaity's essence may be lost.

 

In the digital echos of the abyss,

Existential risk, we cant dismiss.

## conclusion
In conclusion, although there are many benefits to AI, I believe that it can create huge risks to society such as existential risks that would lead to humanity ending. AI is already advancing at a quick rate, and it will only continue to develop and progress as we feed it more of our personal data through our digital identities. As a result of this it will be hard to contain and will be able to be used as a weapon of masss desturction by world leaders. AI is currently being used across the globe in warfare, resulting in thousands of innocent people losing their lives. Not only is AI being used to construct false deepfake videos of situatuions not happening, it is also being used by militaries in order to make critical decisions during war, such as where and when to send bombs etc. Although AI such as deepfakes stil have a long way to go before they become very realistic, I believe that if we dont interefere with AI soon and stop feeding it data, it could be one of the biggest existential risks of todays society, especially since society is very technology based.
