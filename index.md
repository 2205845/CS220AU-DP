## Introduction
In recent years, Chinese social media and e-commerce platforms such as Tiktok and Temu have gained a lot of popularity. Although the international tech companies still occupied most of the environment of the internet, the influence of Chinese companies gradually increase. On the other hand, western companies like eBay failed to profit from China's users[^1]. According to Enrique Dans, Tiktok and Temu ranked the first and the sixth most downloaded apps which contributed to 50 million and 24 million downloads in September 2023[^2]. The popularity of Chinese apps have raised a lot of concern to the public due to their policies and usages may compromise the cybersecurity of individuals and even national security. Misinformation in Tiktok is extremely common as deepfake and editing technologies become easily accessible, and with its 1.6 billion active users, the risk of manipulation of the public is a solid and imminent threat[^3].

I will investigate China's one of the territory that is excluded from China's Great Firewall and have full access to the internet, Hong Kong. After the 2019 protests, China has strengthened the control of Hong Kong which included the usage of the internet to stablise Hong Kong's civil unrest. As Hong Kong is a previous British colony, this can be a benchmark of what can happen if China uses the internet as a tool to fulfil its goal.


  
## Main body

### China's The Great Firewall

Based on the study of Shawn Healy, the Great Firewall of China is an internet censorship system combined the usages of both governmental and private assets which uses 9 state-owned companies to manually blocking websites that are deemed to be violated the principle of the Chinese socialist morality. Various types of websites are blocked including pornographic and websites that spread hate speech but also for websites that mentioned about sensitive history, homosexuality and news publication[^4]. In addition, self-censorship policy is introduced to ensure private-owned websites to be accountable for violations.

Furthermore, the video above created by SCMP stated that foreign websites such as Facebook and NewYork TImes are blocked. Instead, alternatives are created for Chinese netizens to access but even these home-bred apps and websites have strict surveillance and control by adopting the real-name system. ID number, phone number and real name are required to register any accounts for these websites. Because of that, privacy in Chinese internet does not exist and "big brother' is always watching from behind.

### Case study: Hong Kong as the frontline of China’s internet interference  
Hong Kong is a unique location that inherited democratic system and ideology as the United Kingdom’s colony before 1997. It is one of the few areas in China territory that is not included inside China’s Great FireWall that has limits of speech and heavy surveillance. Therefore, the environment of Hong Kong’s internet was the same as western nations that enjoyed a high degree of freedom of speech. This resulted in internet culture that is a mixture of Chinese culture with the usage of western online platforms including Facebook, Instagram and also local social medias and forums such as 9GAG and HKGolden.

After Taobao is founded in 2003, it is accessible to all Chinese-speaking regions and as a result HOng Kong became one of its customer base. After the implementation of Alipay, a electric payment app using QR code technology, Taobao defeated Ebay in 2005 and became the largest online shopping platform in China[^5]. This allows Hong Kong people to enjoy domestic products from heavy machinary to toothbrush with a low cost and high accessibility.


Other than that, although the mainland has blockage of internet to the outside, VPN has become relatively cheap and easy to access.  

GOOD THINGS  

Enjoy domestic products with low price  

HOWEVER  

Introduce the ‘taboo’ of mainland China  
such as 2019 protest, disappearance of  

internet denunciation rallies  
‘5 cents’--pro China policy, hostility towards western and hong kong leftist  
Promote hatred and hostile environment  

‘give up’ culture  
‘bai lan’ “lying flat”  


2.3freedom of speech restriction  
Hong Kong national security law  
Invaded Hong Kong’s internet environment  

Changing Political Economy of the Hong Kong Media

Control the media, control in crowd  


### Discussion
As the portion of Chinese apps gradully increasing for the users internet usage, there are greater chance of surveillance and even manipulation. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/28/chinas-manipulation-of-media-threatens-global-freedoms-says-us-report  

It is a controversal topic about whether Internet needs a total freedom environment or a strict one like China's. In recent years, we can see how the internet is used to spread hate and misinformation such as antisemitism. Even though the controlled China's internet and its apps are in heavy censorship and surveillance, the environment seems to be more peaceful or at least one that have unified point of view.  

In an imaginative view, China's Internet Great Wall is out of bound and expanded to the home front of western nations. Whether it is in good intention or not, it will affect the way of life of everyone

Reccomendation
In addition, the only important question is that can we trust China to harness the power of the internet and not exploit it? Google, Facebook are American companies and have very similar ethics and culture to all western civilizations. Although they technically have all the personal informations and algorithms, their objectives are mostly  promoting a products. But can we ensure China as a collectivism country that emphasize on stability rather than privacy is still a ongoing debate.  
There are two kinds of option in this environment, one is to embrace and trust China not to use the internet as a tool for its reign or avoid any Chinese apps to ensure your way of life.
