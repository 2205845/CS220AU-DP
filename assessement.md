## Self-assessment
Using the marking rubric, I've assessed my own progress: <!-- move the symbols in the table below -->

I think my essay does a good job at linking existential risk, digital identity and AI. I think my website is well structured and unbiased as overall it's about existential risk of AI, however i still mention Positive sides to AI.I think the videos and photos I've used help get across my points in a way that's accessible, fun and easy for readers, however I wish i had more resources so I was able to create more of my own photos rather than sourcing ones from the internet. I think although it's not too strongly written, my poem is also good at getting across the main points of my essay in a simpler and short form. I think my examples such as Israel and Palestine are good however I could of used more quotes and references to get across my points in a more academic way. In addition to this I use real life examples of AI being used in negative ways, such as in the Ukraine and Russia war, by doing this it gives the readers a more realistic picture of how AI is being currently used, and shows how if it advances in the future it can be used in negative ways that will end with existential risk of humanity. Although the video I used is useful, I struggled to find others relating to the topic.

The introduction of the essay makes it very clear that the topic to be existential risks and the advancing technologies of artificial intelligence with brief but sufficient explanation of how they are related. The writer provides reference to introduce specific idea and, in this case, artificial intelligence to ensure the reader to have enough understanding in order to continue the reading. Up to date and relevant incidents are introduced into the essay to create a scenario that the reader can be related and easier to understand. Videos are provided to further supporting and explaining the topic. Poem is a nice touch for the ending as it gives some time for readers to think deeply of their existential risk and AI. Conclusion is able to group up every point in the essay.

I think existential risks and digital identity part can provide some examples, even if it is not related to AI. When introducing AI, some statistics can be used for using how we heavily implemented AI to our life making it completely undetachable. This can provide a strong support that AI can create an existential risk. The YouTube video maybe needs to adjust the size so it fits the paragraph and maybe mention about what the video mentions as the readers may not watch the video. Some images can be added in to make the appearance to be more professional. I think Kris said use footer reference. It is like that:
The body:
the risk of manipulation of the public is a tangible and imminent threat[^3]
